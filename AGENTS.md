# Tool Rules (compose-agentsmd)

- **Session gate**: before starting substantive work for each externally supplied human/operator instruction, run `compose-agentsmd` once from the project root. AGENTS.md contains the rules you operate under; stale rules cause rule violations. Do not rerun this gate within the same instruction after tool results, retries, generated continuations, or resumed execution. If you discover you skipped this step mid-session, stop, run it immediately, re-read the diff, and adjust your behavior before continuing.
- `compose-agentsmd` intentionally regenerates `AGENTS.md`; any resulting `AGENTS.md` diff is expected and must not be treated as an unexpected external change.
- If `compose-agentsmd` is not available, run it via `npx compose-agentsmd`. If `npx` is unavailable or cannot fetch the package, install it via npm with an environment-appropriate method such as `npm install -g compose-agentsmd` when global installs are permitted, or a user-local npm prefix when global installs are not permitted.
- To update shared/global rules, use `compose-agentsmd edit-rules` to locate the writable rules workspace, make changes only in that workspace, then run `compose-agentsmd apply-rules` (do not manually clone or edit the rules source repo outside this workflow).
- If you find an existing clone of the rules source repo elsewhere, do not assume it is the correct rules workspace; always treat `compose-agentsmd edit-rules` output as the source of truth.
- `compose-agentsmd apply-rules` pushes the rules workspace when `source` is GitHub (if the workspace is clean), then regenerates `AGENTS.md` with refreshed rules.
- Do not edit `AGENTS.md` directly; update the source rules and regenerate.
- `tools/tool-rules.md` is the shared rule source for all repositories that use compose-agentsmd.
- Before applying any rule updates, present the planned changes first with an ANSI-colored diff-style preview, ask for explicit approval, then make the edits.
- These tool rules live in tools/tool-rules.md in the compose-agentsmd repository; do not duplicate them in other rule modules.

# Node module system (ESM)

- Default to TypeScript (.ts/.tsx); use JavaScript only for tool-required config
  files.
- Always set "type": "module" in package.json.
- Prefer ESM with .js extensions for JavaScript config/scripts (e.g.,
  next.config.js as ESM).

# Node package publishing

- For scoped npm packages, set publishConfig.access = "public".
- Set files to constrain the published contents.
- If a clean npm install is insufficient, use prepare (or equivalent) to build.

## Verification

- Use npm pack --dry-run to inspect the package contents.
- Run npm test when tests exist.

# Web UI and automation

## Browser automation

- For web automation or UI verification, use the browser automation tooling available in the current agent environment.
- If browser launch fails due to missing Playwright binaries, run `npx playwright install chromium` and retry.

## UI verification and E2E

- For user-visible UI changes, verify in a real browser; if not possible, explain and provide manual steps.
- Always add E2E tests for user-visible changes; if no harness exists, add one.
- Run E2E in CI and require it for PR merges; do not defer correctness coverage
  to scheduled runs.
- For React UI changes, add tests that cover initial mount and at least one
  update (re-render) path; include unmount/cleanup when relevant.
- If behavior differs between first render and later renders (effects, caching,
  hydration), cover both paths explicitly.
- Configure E2E to fail fast and avoid auto-opening browsers (headless/no-open).
- For Next.js E2E, prefer next build + next start.
- If Playwright tests fail to launch, clear playwright/.cache and retry.
- When adding/changing links, add tests that verify the target resolves; if not
  feasible, document manual verification.
- For cross-system integration flows, add an end-to-end test (or a contract test
  at the boundary). If impractical, document the limitation and get explicit
  user approval before skipping.
- Use established icon libraries; do not handcraft custom icons or inline SVGs.
